- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit processes
- **Automatic Updates**: Built-in update system for seamless version management

## Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Process Attachment**
   - Enter the target process name (e.g., `notepad.exe`)
   - Click "Attach to Process" or use the process selector

2. **Memory Scanning**
   - Input the value to search for in the scan field
   - Click "Start Scan" to begin automatic type detection
   - Review results with different data type interpretations

3. **Result Filtering**
   - Modify the value in the target application
   - Enter the new value and click "Next Scan"
   - Repeat the process to isolate target memory addresses

4. **Memory Modification**
   - Right-click on scan results to access modification options
   - Apply changes in real-time with immediate effect

### Advanced Features

- **Pattern Scanning**: Search using hex patterns with wildcard support (`48 8B ? ? 90`)
- **Memory Freezing**: Lock values to prevent application modification
- **Batch Processing**: Select and modify multiple memory addresses simultaneously
