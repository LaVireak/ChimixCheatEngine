## Features

### Memory Analysis

- **Universal Value Scanning**: Automatically detects multiple data types (int8, int16, int32, float, double, string)
- **Advanced Pattern Matching**: Hex byte pattern searching with wildcard support
- **Real-time Filtering**: Next scan functionality to narrow down memory results
- **Batch Operations**: Simultaneous modification of multiple memory addresses

### User Interface

- **Modern Desktop Application**: Clean interface built with Electron
- **Process Management**: Intuitive process attachment and monitoring tools
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based backend integration
- **Comprehensive Results Display**: Advanced memory result visualization and modification tools

### Core Engine

- **High-Performance C++ Backend**: Optimized memory scanning algorithms
- **Safe Memory Operations**: Secure memory reading and writing with proper error handling
- **Cross-Architecture Support**: Compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit processes
- **Automatic Updates**: Built-in update system for seamless version management

## Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Process Attachment**
   - Enter the target process name (e.g., `notepad.exe`)
   - Click "Attach to Process" or use the process selector

2. **Memory Scanning**
   - Input the value to search for in the scan field
   - Click "Start Scan" to begin automatic type detection
   - Review results with different data type interpretations

3. **Result Filtering**
   - Modify the value in the target application
   - Enter the new value and click "Next Scan"
   - Repeat the process to isolate target memory addresses

4. **Memory Modification**
   - Right-click on scan results to access modification options
   - Apply changes in real-time with immediate effect

### Advanced Features

- **Pattern Scanning**: Search using hex patterns with wildcard support (`48 8B ? ? 90`)
- **Memory Freezing**: Lock values to prevent application modification
- **Batch Processing**: Select and modify multiple memory addresses simultaneously
